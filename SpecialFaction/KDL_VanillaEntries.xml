    description="A city ship has arrived into the galaxy. It will try to create structures accross the galaxy in order to grow more prosperous and powerful.

&lt;color=#f25e1c&gt;HIGH IMPACT:&lt;/color&gt; Depending on the intensity and invasion time the impact of the faction will be vary greatly. For example an immediate invasion, intensity 10 will be around the realms of Medium to High Impact, while a having the invasion later could turn it into a complete flop. Note that killing the City Ship will make the faction unable to build new structures. Here's what you can expect overall :
Roaming around in a powerful ship, this foe's impact is mainly felt if they manage to seed and upgrade a few structures. Even if they were to fail in that endeavor, the City Ship remains a noticeable enemy."
